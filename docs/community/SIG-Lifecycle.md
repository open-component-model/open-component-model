# SIG Lifecycle Guide

This guide describes the lifecycle management for Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in the OCM project, including creation, operation, and archiving/dissolution.

## 1. Creation

- Read the SIG Governance Model and Lifecycle Guide to understand the process and requirements.
- Draft your SIG charter (see example link in the Lifecycle Guide), outlining scope, responsibilities, leadership, meeting cadence, and processes.
- Fill out the SIG Submission Template with all required info (purpose, scope, initial leadership, meeting cadence, communication channels, repository needs).
- Submit your proposal and charter as a new issue in the OCM community repository ([create issue](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/issues)).
- The OCM Technical Steering Committee (TSC) reviews and approves proposals.
- Once approved, announce your SIG in the community (mailing list, Slack, etc.) and update documentation.
- Add your SIG to `sigs.yaml` and update documentation as needed.

## 2. Operation

- Schedule regular meetings (at least every 4-6 weeks; cadence may be adjusted for project needs).
- Use the Meeting Notes Template (see Operations Guide) and link notes from your SIG page in the community repo.
- Communicate openly in public forums and project-owned repositories.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation and a simple roadmap for SIG activities and enhancements.
- SIGs are responsible for code, tests, issue triage, PR reviews, and bug fixes in their area.
- Onboard new members using the docs and templates provided.
- SIGs may sponsor working groups for focused efforts.
- SIGs may provide an annual summary of activities (optional).

## 3. Archiving/Dissolution

- Discuss retirement/archiving with SIG members and the TSC.
- Announce the retirement to the community (mailing list, Slack, etc.).
- Archive SIG documentation and repositories.
- Update `sigs.yaml` and the community documentation to reflect the change.
- Record the retirement in meeting minutes and the OCM repository.
- SIGs may be archived or dissolved by consensus of SIG members or by decision of the OCM TSC if inactive, obsolete, or no longer aligned with project needs.
- If a SIG is unable to regularly establish consistent quorum or fulfill its Organizational Management responsibilities for 3 or more months, it SHOULD be considered for retirement.
- If inactivity persists for 6 or more months, the SIG MUST be retired.
- Archiving process includes: announcement to the community, archiving documentation and repositories, and updating the community repo.

For a machine-readable list of SIGs and their details, see [sigs.yaml](./sigs.yaml).
