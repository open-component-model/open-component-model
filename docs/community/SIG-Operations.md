# SIG Operations Guide

This guide provides best practices for operating a Special Interest Group (SIG) in the OCM project.

## Meetings

- Meet regularly (at least every 4-6 weeks, or as needed).
- Keep public meeting notes and link them from the SIG's page in the community repo.
- Optionally record meetings and make them available to the community.

## Communication

- Use public forums and project-owned repositories for all work and collaboration.
- Avoid private decision-making and communication.

## Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date documentation and a simple roadmap for SIG activities and enhancements.
- Provide clear contributing instructions (CONTRIBUTING.md) if SIG contributor steps differ from the general OCM guide.
- For standard contribution processes, see the main [OCM Contributing Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Code & Issue Ownership

- All related work must happen in a project-owned GitHub organization and repository.
- Code and tests must be explicitly owned and supported by the SIG.
- SIGs are responsible for issue triage, PR reviews, test-failure response, bug fixes, and ongoing maintenance in their area.

## Working Groups

- SIGs may sponsor working groups for focused efforts.

## Annual Summary (Optional)

- SIGs may provide a yearly summary of activities and health.

## Onboarding Checklist for New SIG Members

- Read the SIG Governance Model, Lifecycle Guide, and Operations Guide.
- Review the SIG charter and understand the SIG's scope, responsibilities, and meeting cadence.
- Join the SIG's communication channels (mailing list, Slack, etc.).
- Get access to relevant repositories and documentation.
- Attend the next scheduled SIG meeting and introduce yourself.
- Review open issues, PRs, and the SIG roadmap to understand current priorities.
- Ask questions and connect with the Chair, Tech Lead, or other members for guidance.

For a machine-readable list of SIGs and their details, see [sigs.yaml](./sigs.yaml).
