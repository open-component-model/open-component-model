# SIG Submission Template

> **Note:** In OCM, the SIG proposal and charter are submitted together in a single step (as a GitHub issue). This simplifies the process for a small project and ensures all required information is available for review and approval. If the project grows, the process can be revisited and split into separate steps as in larger projects like Kubernetes.

Use this template to propose a new Special Interest Group (SIG) for the OCM project.
