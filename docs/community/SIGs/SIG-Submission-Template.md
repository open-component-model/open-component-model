# SIG Submission Template

> **Note:** In OCM, the SIG proposal and charter are submitted together in a single step (as a GitHub issue). This simplifies the process for a small project and ensures all required information is available for review and approval. If the project grows, the process can be revisited and split into separate steps as in larger projects like Kubernetes.

Use this template to propose a new Special Interest Group (SIG) for the OCM project.

## SIG Charter

Please provide a SIG charter covering the following topics (see [SIG Handbook](SIG-Handbook.md) for details):

- Scope and mission of the SIG
- Responsibilities and deliverables
- Leadership roles (Chair, Tech Lead; both roles may be held by the same person)
- Initial Voting Members (Chair and Tech Lead must be listed and are always voting members)
- Meeting cadence and communication channels
- How the SIG interacts with other groups and the community
- Repository needs and code/test ownership statement

Refer to the [SIG Handbook](SIG-Handbook.md) for governance, decision-making, voting member process, and other operational details. These do not need to be repeated in the charter.
