## Action Items

- [X] ~Christian~ Philipp to confirm ODG based repositories in OCM Github Organization only use Licenses acceptable for
  reuse under Apache 2.0 or MIT to conform with Charter.
  - Some delivery artifacts are not publishable under Apache 2.0 (GPL / AGPL questions on compatibility with Apache
      2.0)
    - ODG Delivery relies on Python as Runtime which contain OS artifacts as well as Database dependencies (
          Postgres)
    - Bash is a typical candidate as well as gcc
  - Looking for SME on LICENSE resolution
  - [ ] Philipp to create a ticket in OCM Github Organization to track this issue
  - [ ] Philipp to clarify how other orgs that are known affected deal with this (i.e. Gardener)
  - [ ] IP Scan we are not safe on the Source Code Repositories within ODG, we will defer this until ODG provides a
      blackduck IP integration (Issue Link TBD)
- [X] Jakob to add Philipp Heil to the TSC
  - Mostly integrated, [OWNERS.md](../OWNERS.md) needs update
- [ ] Currently SAP OSPO still has Ownership and Jakob will reach out to them to limit Ownership. Jakob to create a small offboarding timeline together with SAP OSPO
  - Generally we can offboard anytime we want
  - Jakob would like to defer this move until NeoNephos Project Guidelines are in place and public
  - Jakob is trying to get the NeoNephos Project Guidelines published
    - Depends on Approval of TAC and needs to be ratified by it before it can be referenced
- [X] Philipp to check if its possible to ignore OCM Bot Accounts (which are normal Github Accounts) from DCO
  enforcement in general to avoid breaking workflows
  - Migrated to Github Apps
- [X] Philipp to clean up ODG related teams (odg-maintainers, ocm-gear-contributors) and name uniformly
  - Teams are migrated <https://github.com/orgs/open-component-model/teams/odg-maintainers>
      and <https://github.com/orgs/open-component-model/teams/odg-collaborators>
