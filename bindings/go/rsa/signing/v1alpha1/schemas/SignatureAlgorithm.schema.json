Apply the same padding function (with expected salt length and hash).\n2. Perform the RSA public key operation on the signature.\n3. Compare the result against the expected padded hash value.\n\nParameters used in OCM:\n- Hash function: SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 based on digest specification for the signing handler.\n- Salt length: equal to the length of the hash output.\n- MGF: MGF1 with the same underlying hash function, non modifiable.\n\nThis is the default algorithm for the new OCM Signature Libraries, but older version of OCM used\nRSASSA-PKCS1 v1.5 as default.",
