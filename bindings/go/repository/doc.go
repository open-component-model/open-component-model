// Package repository provides an abstraction layer for working
// with different OCM (Open Component Model) repository technologies.
//
// By programming against these technology-agnostic repository interfaces,
// consumers of the module can seamlessly switch between
// repository backends without changing their application logic.
//
// Key features:
//   - Defines core interfaces for component version repositories, including
//     methods for adding, retrieving, and listing component versions.
//   - Supports extensibility for new repository technologies by allowing them to
//     implement the provided interfaces.
//   - Facilitates integration with the broader OCM ecosystem by standardizing
//     repository interactions.
//   - Implements higher abstraction layer functionality that does not care about
//     or depend on the underlying repository technology, but only on the
//     interfaces defined in this package (such as the fallback repository).
//
// Use this module when you need to work with OCM repositories in a generic way,
// or when building new repository backends that should be compatible with the
// OCM tooling and workflows.
