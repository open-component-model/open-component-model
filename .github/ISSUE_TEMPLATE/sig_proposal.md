> **Note:** In OCM, the SIG proposal and charter are submitted together in a single step as Github issue. This simplifies the process for a small project and ensures all required information is available for review and approval.

This proposal submission is intentionally minimal. All substantive content (scope, responsibilities, leadership & voting members, meeting cadence, communications, code/test ownership, dependencies) must be provided exclusively in the **Charter document**.

## Proposal

Brief summary of the SIG's goal and scope.

## Required Links

- **Charter PR:** _Link to your charter pull request_
- **`sigs.yaml` PR:** _To be created after SIG approval_

## TSC Review

- **Target TSC meeting date:** `YYYY-MM-DD` _(optional)_

_For upcoming TSC meeting dates, check the [TSC meeting notes](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/tree/main/docs/steering/meeting-notes)_

## Additional Context _(Optional)_

_Provide brief additional context if helpful for reviewers (maximum 5 sentences). Do not duplicate charter content._

## Charter Requirements

- Create the charter as a markdown document in a new folder: `SIG-<sig-name>`
- Location: [`docs/community/SIGs`](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/tree/main/docs/community/SIGs) directory
- Submit as a pull request and link it above
