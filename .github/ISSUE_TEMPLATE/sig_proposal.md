> **Note:** In OCM, the SIG proposal and charter are submitted together in a single step as Github issue. This simplifies the process for a small project and ensures all required information is available for review and approval.

This submission is intentionally minimal. Please keep *all* substantive content (scope, responsibilities, leadership & voting members, meeting cadence, communications, code/test ownership, dependencies) exclusively in the **Charter**.

The **Charter** should be created as markdown document in a new folder `SIG-<sig-name>` under the [`docs/community/SIGs`](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/tree/main/docs/community/SIGs) directory in the OCM community repo, and linked to below.

## TL;DR (2–4 sentences)

Brief summary of the SIG’s goal and scope.

## Links

- **Charter** PR: < link to PR for charter >
- **`sigs.yaml`** PR: < link to PR for `sigs.yaml` > (to be created after approval)

## TSC Agenda

- Target TSC meeting date: `YYYY-MM-DD` (optional)

## Optional context for reviewers (≤5 sentences)

Short additional context if helpful. Do not duplicate Charter content.
